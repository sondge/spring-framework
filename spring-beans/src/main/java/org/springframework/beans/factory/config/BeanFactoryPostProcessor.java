/**
 * Factory hook that allows for custom modification of an application context's
 * bean definitions, adapting the bean property values of the context's underlying
 * bean factory.
 *
 * 在 ApplicationContext 的 BeanDefinition以及调整允许用户修改工厂钩子
 *
 * <p>Useful for custom config files targeted at system administrators that
 * override bean properties configured in the application context. See
 * {@link PropertyResourceConfigurer} and its concrete implementations for
 * out-of-the-box solutions that address such configuration needs.
 *
 * <p>A {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} may interact with and modify bean
 * definitions, but never bean instances. Doing so may cause premature bean
 * instantiation, violating the container and causing unintended side-effects.
 * If bean instance interaction is required, consider implementing
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} instead.
 *
 * <h3>Registration</h3>
 * <p>An {@code ApplicationContext} auto-detects {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor}
 * beans in its bean definitions and applies them before any other beans get created.
 * A {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} may also be registered programmatically
 * with a {@code ConfigurableApplicationContext}.
 *
 * <h3>Ordering</h3>
 * <p>{@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} beans that are autodetected in an
 * {@code ApplicationContext} will be ordered according to
 * {@link org.springframework.core.PriorityOrdered} and
 * {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered} semantics. In contrast,
 * {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} beans that are registered programmatically
 * with a {@code ConfigurableApplicationContext} will be applied in the order of
 * registration; any ordering semantics expressed through implementing the
 * {@code PriorityOrdered} or {@code Ordered} interface will be ignored for
 * programmatically registered post-processors. Furthermore, the
 * {@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order @Order} annotation is not
 * taken into account for {@code BeanFactoryPostProcessor} beans.
